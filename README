# Uranus

Uranus is a easy-to-use SGX runtime based on OpenJDK. It provides
two annotation primitives: JECall and JOCall. For more details
on Uranus's design, please see the paper.

## How to build Uranus

Building Uranus is as easy as building OpenJDK. We have tested running Uranus with the following setup:

- Linux Ubuntu 16.04 LTS x64


First, we need to install a modified version of SGX SDK

```Bash
git clone https://github.com/jianyu-m/linux-sgx -b sgx_1.9
cd linux-sgx
# download dependencies
sudo apt-get install build-essential ocaml automake autoconf libtool wget python
# psw dependencies
sudo apt-get install libssl-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev protobuf-compiler libprotobuf-dev
# build sdk and psw
make sdk_install_pkg
make psw_install_pkg
# install sdk and psw
./linux/installer/bin/sgx_linux_x64_sdk_${version}.bin
./linux/installer/bin/sgx_linux_x64_psw_${version}.bin
```

Then, install dependencies for openjdk

```Bash
sudo apt-get install cmake
```

Finally, compile Uranus:

```Bash
./confiure; make
```

If you want to build with the simulation mode, use

```Bash
make SGX_MODE=SIM
```
