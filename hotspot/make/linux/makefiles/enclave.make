# To generate a proper enclave, it is recommended to follow below guideline to link the trusted libraries:
#    1. Link sgx_trts with the `--whole-archive' and `--no-whole-archive' options,
#       so that the whole content of trts is included in the enclave.
#    2. For other libraries, you just need to pull the required symbols.
#       Use `--start-group' and `--end-group' to link these libraries.
# Do NOT move the libraries linked with `--start-group' and `--end-group' within `--whole-archive' and `--no-whole-archive' options.
# Otherwise, you may get some undesirable errors.
